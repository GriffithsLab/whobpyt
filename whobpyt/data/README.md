# Data

In general, it is more efficient to store the data as:

- Number_of_Nodes x Number_of_Time_Points for analysis 
		- Format of empirical data
		- Format returned by Model Fitting
		- Format for Objective Function
		- Format for Plotting and Analysis
		
- Number_of_Time_Points x Number_of_Nodes for numerical simulation
		- Format of input
		- Format of noise
		- Format of sim output
