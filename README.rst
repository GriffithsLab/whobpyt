*WhoBPyT* is a PyTorch-based Python library for mathematical modelling of large-scale brain network dynamics, obtuse literary allusion, and model-based analysis of neuroimaging and neurophysiology data.

It is developed primarily by researchers in the `Whole-Brain Modelling Group`_
at the `CAMH Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics`_ & University of Toronto.

Note that this project is relatively new and under active development, so the contents of this repo are subject to substantial change. If you are interested in using WhoBPyT in your research (and especially if you are interested in contributing to the code base development), please get in touch by emailing john dot griffiths at utoronto dot ca, or just introduce yourself via an issue.  


Structure
---------

There are three main components to the code base:

|  ``doc`` folder - Documentation pages text and organization
|  ``whobpyt`` folder - The importable python library
|  ``examples`` folder - Example usage scripts that become the gallery items in the CI-managed sphinx gallery site
