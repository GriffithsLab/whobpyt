WhoBPyT - Whole-Brain Modelling in PyTorch
=================
(`Or There and Back Again <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit>`_)


Summary
-------

``whobpyt`` (pronounce as 'hobbit') is a Python library for PyTorch-based whole-brain modeling in Python.

Please note that the code here is still very preliminary, under active
development, and subject to substantial change.


Rationale
---------

As open source and open science advocates, we have elected to pursue a
‘fully open’ and public development approach here. A chief motivation
behind this is to bring in contributors and collaborators who are
interested in working together to move things forward more quickly that
any of us would be able to individually. So, if you are interested in
getting involved, don’t hesitate to reach out to John ( j dot
davidgriffiths at gmail dot com ), or just introduce yourself via an
issue.

Structure
---------

There are three main components to the code base:


|  ``doc`` folder - Documentation pages text and organization
|  ``whobpyt`` folder - The importable python library
|  ``examples`` folder - Example usage scripts that become the gallery
  items in the CI-managed sphinx gallery site
