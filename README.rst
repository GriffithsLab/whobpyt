*WhoBPyT* is a PyTorch-based Python library for mathematical modelling of large-scale brain network dynamics, obtuse literary allusion, and model-based analysis of neuroimaging and neurophysiology data.

It is developed primarily by researchers in the `Whole-Brain Modelling Group`_
at the `CAMH Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics`_ & University of Toronto. 

See the `documentation pages`_ for further info on the motivation, design, usage of the WhoBPyT library, including examples of how we and others are using it to pursue our precious research questions in several neuroscience sub-fields. 

A selection of highlight info is also included below for your convenience. 

Happy Questing!
