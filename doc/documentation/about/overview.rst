Overview
================

WHOBPYT (Whole-Brain Optimization for Biophysical PYThon models) is a flexible, PyTorch-compatible simulation and inversion toolkit for large-scale brain models. It supports neural mass models, neural field models, and conductance-based models, enabling biophysically informed inference from EEG and power spectral density (PSD) data.

This package is designed for researchers in computational neuroscience, brain modeling, and mental health, offering tools to fit EEG/PSD data to biologically interpretable models with variational inference and gradient-based optimization.
